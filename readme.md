Exercise #1: SELECTING/MANIPULATING ELEMENTS

    Select Node #1 using the getElementById() method, and change the text to: “I used the getElementById(“node1”) method to access this”
    Select Node #2 using the getElementsByClassName() method, and change the text to: "I used the getElementByClassName("node2") method to access this"
    Select ALL the h3 tags using the getElementsByTagName() method, and change the text to: "I used the getElementByTagName("h3") method to access all of these"

Exercise #2: CREATING/APPENDING/INSERTING ELEMENTS/OBJECTS

    Create a paragraph element using this element.createElement() and put this text inside "This node was created using the createElement() method"
    Append the created node to the parent node using the element.appendChild() method (Keep in mind that you’ll need to select the parent node first)
    Create a <a> element using this element.createElement() and put this text inside "I am a <a> tag"
    Insert the created <a> in the parent node, but before the <p> you just created using the element.insertBefore() method
    Add a link href to the <a> by selecting the anchorElement.link property

Exercise #3: REMOVING/REPLACING ELEMENTS/OBJECTS

    Replace the "Child Node" with a new <p> element that reads "New Child Node" using the replaceChild() method.
    Remove the "New Child Node" using the remove() method or removeChild() method.

Exercise #4: ELEMENTS FROM AN ARRAY

Use the following array of values to generate a list on the DOM

let list = [ "apples", "bananas", "carrots", "dragon fruit", "eggplant", "fish", "grapes", "honey", "ice bag", "juice (any kind)" ];

    Create an unordered list element
    Iterate over the array values, and create a list item element for each
    Append the new list items to the unordered list element
    Append the unordered list to the div#container under exercise 4

Exercise #5: DOM EVENTS

    Write a function called show which creates a new div with an alerting message to the user with this message -> "Clicking the button triggers the onclick event, which calls the JS function show()... which alerts the user"
    This div should be a 'modal' that covers the main content on the screen
    BONUS: The modal popup should be able to be closed. Refactor for this functionality
